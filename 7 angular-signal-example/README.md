# AngularSignalExample

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.16.
This is the seventh lesson from the [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-angular-14-course-learn-frontend-development/).

**NOTE:**
In this section, Jannick updated his Angular to 17, which is needed for signal inputs. I did not upgrade my version and did not work on that part of the course.

Learned:
- There are writable and readonly signals
- A signal can call another signal
- The signal that is called by the initial one, is a computed signal, which is readonly
- You can open the Angular Devtool browser extension to view the signal values
- Signal inputs is used to send a signal from component A to component B

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
