# BookManagement

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.16.
This is the fifth lesson from the [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-angular-14-course-learn-frontend-development/).
Implemented:
- app.state
  - naming arrays is the same as naming an entity
  - AppState is also used for type safety so that is it consistent throughout the entire application
- @ngrx/store, @ngrx/effects (v16.3.0)
  - create an action
  - create a reducer
    - the name of the "parameter" in the reducer has to match the action

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
